                  Offset Climate change is a major issue in our civilization,
                  and one of the greenhouse gases that exacerbate it is CO2.
                  This gas absorbs radiation and stores heat in the atmosphere,
                  resulting in a variety of environmental disasters. The most
                  effective measure is to limit your CO2 emissions via daily
                  activities; nevertheless, carbon offsets can provide a
                  solution by producing a benefit for the earth and aiding
                  Earth's natural filtering. These carbon-offsetting projects
                  rely on the preservation of existing forests as well as the
                  planting of new trees.

                  The Personal Carbon Footprint attempts to quantify an
                  individual's environmental effect. Its computation enables you
                  to reduce or optimize your energy efficiency and adjust your
                  consumption patterns to lessen your environmental effect. Many
                  of our regular activities, such as consuming power,
                  transportation, housing, food, and trash disposal, contribute
                  to greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions add together to
                  form a household's carbon footprint.

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-base">
            Creatures on the earth are alive because they inhale oxygen from the
            air, which helps run their bodily mechanisms and exhale carbon
            dioxide as a by-product of the function of the body. Nature's only
            source of oxygen is the trees. Through a process called
            photosynthesis, trees prepare food for their survival.

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-base">
            This process requires carbon dioxide from the air as a material and
            produces oxygen as a by-product. Trees emit this gas into the air,
            increasing its proportion and thereby meeting the need of the living
            creatures. An acre of land full of mature trees can produce enough
            oxygen for 18 people in a year.

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-base">
            Trees absorb pollutant gases like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide,

            Trees and shrubs, like all plants, also help to protect us from

            nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus on our land surfaces can
            contaminate our water, but the roots of shrubs intercept these
            pollutants. This is why it is especially important to plant shrubs
